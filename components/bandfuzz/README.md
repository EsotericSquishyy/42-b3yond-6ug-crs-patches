**BandFuzz** is a collaborative fuzzing framework for large-scale parallel
fuzzing campaigns. It dynamically schedules fuzzing strategies using
reinforcement learning, enabling adaptive and efficient fuzzing of real-world
targets.

## Features

- Dynamic scheduling of fuzzing strategies using reinforcement learning
- Orchestration of large-scale parallel fuzzing campaigns
- Support for real-world targets (e.g., Google OSS-Fuzz)
- Integrations: PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, OpenTelemetry
- Docker and Docker Compose support

## Project History

- **2022**: Project initiated at Northwestern University
- **2023**: First place at SBFT Fuzzing Competition (ICSE 2023)
- **2024**: Optimizations for DARPA AIxCC competition
- **2025**: Refinements for AIxCC finals; production-ready framework

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or later
- Make
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional)
- PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis (if not using Docker)

### Installation
